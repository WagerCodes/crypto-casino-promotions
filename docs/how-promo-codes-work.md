# How Promo Codes Work in Crypto Casinos

Promo codes are short strings used to unlock promotional offers on crypto casino platforms. They are typically applied during registration, in account settings, or when making a deposit.

This document explains how promo codes generally work and what users should understand before using them.

## Where promo codes are applied

Promo codes are commonly entered in one of the following places:

- During account registration or sign-up
- In a user profile or rewards section
- On the deposit or checkout screen
- Via partner or referral landing pages

The exact placement depends on the platform.

## What promo codes usually unlock

A promo code may unlock:

- A welcome bonus
- A deposit-based incentive
- Cashback or rakeback eligibility
- Free spins or free cases
- Access to a specific promotion or reward tier

Not all codes offer the same benefits, and some apply only to certain users.

## Why promo codes change or expire

Promo codes are not permanent. They may change because:

- Marketing campaigns rotate
- Eligibility rules are updated
- Promotions reach usage limits
- Platforms adjust risk or compliance rules

Because of this, codes that worked previously may no longer be valid.

## What to check before using a promo code

Before using any promo code, users should review:

- Eligibility (new users vs existing users)
- Timing or expiry windows
- Minimum deposit requirements
- Usage or wagering conditions
- Game or feature restrictions

Understanding these factors helps avoid confusion.

## Responsible use

Promo codes are optional and may encourage higher spending.

Users should always set limits and review official platform terms.
